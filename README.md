# Invoice Ninja version 5! 

## Quick Start

Currently the client portal and API are of alpha quality, to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja.git
git checkout v5-stable
cp .env.example .env
composer update
php artisan key:generate
```

```

```
php artisan serve

## Contribution guide.

Code Style to follow [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) standards.

All methods names to be in CamelCase

All variables names to be in snake_case

Where practical code should be strongly typed, ie your methods must return a type ie

`public function doThis() : void`

PHP >= 7.3 allows the return type Nullable so there should be no circumstance a type cannot be return by using the following:

`public function doThat() ?:string`

To improve chances of PRs being merged please include tests to ensure your code works well and integrates with the rest of the project.

## Current work in progress

Invoice Ninja is currently being written in a combination of Laravel for the API and Client Portal and Flutter for the front end management console. This will allow an immersive and consistent experience across any device: mobile, tablet or desktop.

To manage our workflow we will be creating separate branches for the client (Flutter) and server (Laravel API / Client Portal) and merge these into a release branch for deployments.
